CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

5 Categories:
1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id #, class . )
2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

Cascading Order
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?
All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default
So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        p {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }

        #para1 {
            text-align: center;
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>

    <p>Every paragraph will be affected by the style.</p>
    <p id="para1">Me too!</p>
    <p>And me!</p>
