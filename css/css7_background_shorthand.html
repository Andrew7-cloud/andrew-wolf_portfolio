CSS background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing:
body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}

background: color image repeat position
 background: #ffffff url("C:/Users/andre/Desktop/web_development/inventory_images/Beaches/kenrick-mills-s6zlp73h_YA-unsplash.jpg") no-repeat right top;
            margin-right: 200px;

When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background:
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position

It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. 
Did not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.

    <p>The background property is a shorthand property for specifying all the background properties in one declaration.
    </p>

    <p>Here, the background image is only shown once, and it is also positioned in the top-right corner.</p>

    <p>We have also added a right margin, so that the text will not write over the background image.</p>
