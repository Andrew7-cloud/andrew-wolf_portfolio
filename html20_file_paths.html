HTML File Paths: describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.
File paths are used when linking to external files, like:
A. Web pages
B. Images
C. Style sheets
D. JavaScripts

Best Practice
It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).
When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. 
All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.

File Path Examples
Path	Description
<img src="picture.jpg">	located in same folder as the current page

<img src="images/picture.jpg">	located in images folder in the current folder

<img src="/images/picture.jpg">	located in images folder at the root of the current web

<img src="../picture.jpg">	located in the folder one level up from the current folder

    <!-- Absolute File Paths
        An absolute file path is the full URL to a file:-->

    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" style="width:300px">

    <h2>Using a Full URL File Path "https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg"</h2>
    <br>

    <!-- Relative File Paths
A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.
In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:-->

    <h2>Using a Relative File Path "/images/picture.jpg"</h2>
    <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" style="width:300px">
    <br>
    <!-- In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:-->

    <h2>Using a Relative File Path src="images/picture.jpg"</h2>
    <img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" style="width:300px">
    <br>
    <!-- In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:-->

    <h2>Using a Relative File Path src="../images/picture.jpg</h2>
    <img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" style="width:300px">
    <br>
