<!-- <input>
type="submit"
The submit button is used to send a form to the server.

name
It can use a name attribute but it does not need to have one.

value
The value attribute is used to control the text that appears on a button.
    Determine text to appear on a button, the default value of buttons on some browsers is ‘Submit query’.
Different browsers will show submit buttons in different ways and tend to fit the visual presentation of the browser.
If you want to control the appearance of a submit button, you can either use CSS (as you will learn on page 343), or you can use an image for the button.
