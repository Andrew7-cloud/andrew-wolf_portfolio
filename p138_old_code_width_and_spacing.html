<!--The width attribute was used on the opening table tag to indicate how wide that table should be and on some opening
    th and td tags to specify the width of individual cells. The value of this attribute is the width of the table or
    cell in pixels. The columns in a table need to form a straight line, so you often only see the width attribute on
    the first row (and all subsequentrows would use that setting). The opening table tag could also use the cellpadding
    attribute to add space inside each cell of the table, and the cellspacing attribute to create space between each
    cell of the table. The values for these attributes were given in pixels.-->
