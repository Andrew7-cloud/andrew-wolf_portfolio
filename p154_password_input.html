<!-- <input>
type="password"
When the type attribute has a value of "password" it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input,
    except the characters are blocked out.

name
The name attribute indicates the name of the password input, which is sent to the server with the password the user enters.

size, maxlength
It can also carry the size and maxlength attributes like the the single-line text input.

Although the password is hidden on the screen, this does not mean that the data in a password control is sent securely to the server.
 You should never use these for sending sensitive data such as credit card numbers.
For full security, the server needs to be set up to communicate with users' browsers using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
 The topic of SSL is beyond the scope of this book, however there are links to learn more about it on the accompanying website.
