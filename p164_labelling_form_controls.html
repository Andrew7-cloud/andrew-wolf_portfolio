<!--  Building a Label with a Text Box
     A label needs an open and close tag.
     Embedd the <input type="text", name = "nameoftextbox" 
-->
<label>Age: <input type="text" name="age" /></label>
<br />
Gender:

<input id="female" type="radio" name="gender" value="f">
<label for="female">Female</label>

<input id="male" type="radio" name="gender" value="m">
<label for="male">Male</label>

<!-- <label>
When introducing form controls, the code was kept simple by indicating the purpose of each one in text next to it.
However, each form control should have its own <label> element as this makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users.
The <label> element can be used in two ways. 
    
It can:
1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input (as shown on the first line of the example to your right).
2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to indicate which form control
     it is a label for (as shown with the radio buttons).

     for 

     The for attribute states which form control the label belongs to.

Note how the radio buttons use the id attribute. 
The value of the id attribute uniquely identifies an element from all other elements on a page.
(The id attribute is covered on page 183.)
The value of the for attribute matches that of the id attribute on the form control it is labelling.
