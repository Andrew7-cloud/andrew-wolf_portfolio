<!-- <select>
size
Add the size attribute to show the number of items visible in multi select box. 
    Its value should be the number of options you want to show at once. 

multiple
Allow users to select multiple options from list by adding the multiple attribute with a value of multiple.

It is a good idea to tell users if they can select more than one option at a time. 
Tip, on a PC they should hold down the control key while selecting multiple options.
    Mac, use the command key while selecting options.
