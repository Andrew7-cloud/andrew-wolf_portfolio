<!-- <form>
    Form controls live inside a <form> element. 
    This element should always carry the action attribute, will usually have a method and id attribute too.
    
    action:  the URL resource or page (on a web server) that will receive the forms information when submitted.  
    value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.
    Every <form> element requires an action attribute.

    Page on a server.  Page has URL.  Use "get" or "post" as methods.         
    
    method: get or post (If method attribute not used, get method used).
    
    Get method: Values from form are added to end of URL specified in the action attribute.
    
    Ideal For:
    ● short forms (search boxes)
    ● when you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending information that should be added to or deleted
    from a database)

    Post Method: Values from form are sent in what are known as HTTP headers.
    As a rule of thumb you should use the post method if your form:
        ● adds information to, or deletes information from, a database
        ● allows users to upload a file
        ● is lengthy
        ● contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords)

id
We look at the id attribute on page 183, but the value is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page
(and is often used by scripts — such as those that check you have entered information into fields that require values).
