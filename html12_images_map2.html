The Areas
Then, add the clickable areas.

A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

Shape
Define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region
You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image. 

Shape="rect"
The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top
