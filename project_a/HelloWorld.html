Welcome to the November 2020 release of Visual Studio Code. As announced in the November iteration plan, we continued to
focus for two weeks on housekeeping GitHub issues and pull requests as documented in our issue grooming guide. Across
all of our VS Code repositories, we closed (either triaged or fixed) 5242 issues, which is even more than during our
last housekeeping iteration in October 2019, where we closed 4622 issues. While we closed issues, you created 2937 new
issues. The main vscode repository now has 2146 open feature requests and 884 open bugs. In addition, we closed 144 pull
requests.
