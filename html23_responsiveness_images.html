<!-- Responsive Images
    Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.

Using the width Property
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:

-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>responsive_images</title>

    <style>
        {}
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h2>Responsive Image</h2>
    <p>When the CSS width property is set in a percentage value, the image will scale up and down when resizing the
        browser window.</p>

    <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;">


</body>

</html>
